# Owl

A simple, header only, math and physics library for the C Language. 

It presently contains a 3D Vector, and Quaternion library. It also contains a very primitive physics library.

All values default to ```double```.

Dependencies :

For ```owlvector.h```     : ```math.h```, ```stdio.h```.

For ```owlquaternion.h``` : ```owlvector.h```.

For ```owlphysics.h```    : ```owlvector.h```.

The code comes with ```#include <stdio.h>``` and ```#include <math.h>```. There's no need to include it in your code again.
